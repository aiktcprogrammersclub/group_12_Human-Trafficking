												Mita's Story 
											
										</strong>
										<p>
											
Mita was trafficked by her neighbor. She says that she &quot;was usually alone at home and grew up as a quiet and lonely child &quot; One day her friend was visiting and her neighbor&#44; Najma invited them to come and eat at her home. Her friend was very hungry and convinced Mita that it was a good idea. They went to the neighbor's home and started to feel "completely out of control&quot;.  She and her friend were drugged.  The girls were then boarded onto a bus. Mita woke the next morning and could not find her friend; Najma responded that "she would never come back". Mita was then picked up by a man and was told that she must entertain him and then he would take her home.  &quot;He came near me and started touching me everywhere.  I cannot put to words as to how I felt at that moment. I shouted and cried out for help."
The next morning the man took her to a house where she saw her friend. &quot;She stood quiet and expressionless for a few minutes and then bursted out crying. She said that she had been raped all night. Finally I realized that we girls were sold as commodities to the vicious desires of customers.  I cried my heart out&#44; but no one heard me. I was brutally beaten up and starved without food for days."
One day&#44; Mita was sent to a man's house.  Some neighbors found out and contacted STOP India.  STOP's president&#44; Roma&#44; along with the police came and rescued her and she directed them to where her friend was.  Both Mita and her friend were rescued.  After giving their testaments&#44; they were taken home to their families.  But the trials were not over.  Najma's son kept his eye on Mita and wanted to harm her.  Eventually her mother sent Mita to STOP's family home where she could be safe&#44; and get an education.  Mita says that she hasn't "really planned anything for the future. I want to be happy and live for today with the hope that tomorrow holds something great for me.&quot;

												Aatmaja's Story  
											
										</strong>
										<p>
											Aatmaja was born into a &quot;broken family"&#44; where she saw her father&#44; an alcoholic&#44; abuse her mother everyday.  Her mother took her anger and frustration out on Aatmaja&#44; telling her that she was &quot;an unwanted child and should have died the day she was born." Shortly after her menstruation started&#44; her mother arranged her marriage with a man who raped and abused her all night. &quot;I was crying out and shouting with pain but he said&#44; &quot;This is the only reason why I married you and you are meant for this." He tried stuffing stones in my vagina. He was psycho."
 One day Aatmaja had enough abuse and left her husbands house to go and live with her mother.  She started teaching tailoring to a girl who lived far away.  The two auto drivers&#44; who became her friends&#44; told her that they could get her a job in Delhi&#44; teaching tailoring for 10&#44;000 rupees a month. She decided to take the job because she &quot;was seeing her mother suffer everyday; and she wanted to do something that could help."
 Next thing she knew&#44; she was at G.B. Road&#44; one of the largest brothel areas of New Delhi.  She was then beaten and kept without food or water. Her first customer was a huge man who had a cynical smile.  She says &quot;how can I ever forget that dreadful night? My hands were tied to the bed&#44; two people parted my legs and held them and the man raped me. He tore my body apart."  The customer then paid the brothel owner 5&#44;000 rupees and Aatmaja was given 50 rupees.
 Aatmaja says that after that day her life became a routine&#44; having sex with many customers a day. One day a customer came that all the other girls refused to have sex with.  The brothel owner made Aatmaja have sex with him without a condom. Later she heard the other girls saying he had a serious medical problem.  She asked the brothel owner about it and she said&#44; &quot;Why do you have to know this. Your life ends here&#44; so why think about living longer."
 One day an English man came to the brothel. He was sent to Aatmaja as a customer&#44; but he didn't even touch her. He was trying to talk to her&#44; but she couldn't understand&#44; but she knew he was a kind man.  The next week a man came to the brothel and took her away.  She wasn't sure what was happening but soon realize that she had been rescued. She was taken to the STOP family home where she met many other young girls like her.
 One day&#44; Aatmaja felt severe stomach pains and was taken to the hospital where she had kidney stones removed. After taking a blood test she found out that she was HIV+.  She says that she doesn't know how long she has to live&#44; but is trying to make the best of each day&#44; each moment that she is alive. Today she doesn't feel ashamed to reveal that she is HIV+ and has learned to fight the trauma and disease.  Now she has a mission&#44; to work for other people with HIV/AIDS. Aatmaja says she is living a fulfilling life now.

												Prema's Story  
											
										</strong>
										<p>
											Prema was born into a poor family in a small village in the district of Dumka&#44; Jharkhand.  Her father died when she was very young and all  of the responsibility for the family fell on her mother. All they could manage to eat was wild roots and &quot;to have one proper meal seemed impossible".  At a young age&#44; Prema began working as a housemaid&#44; but fell sick and had to quit.  She says &quot;again&#44; the wheel of hunger and starvation began to take toll on our lives". Prema says&#44; one day they didn't have an ounce of food and she tried to fill her stomach on water. Angry and frustrated she decided to leave.
 
Prema went to the nearest railway station and boarded a train to Patna and then to Kolkata.  She didn't know where she was going&#44; or what she was going to do.  When she arrived in Kolkata&#44; she spent the whole day sitting at the platform. The next day a couple approached her and asked her what she was doing.  They invited her to their house to work.  After a month of cleaning&#44; cooking&#44; and washing&#44; they said they would take her to Delhi&#44; to work at their sister's house where she would make more money. She agreed because she desperately wanted to make more money to send back home to her mother and brother.
 The couple took her to Delhi and asked her to wait at the train station.  A few hours later a lady came up to Prema and said that she was their sister. The lady then took Prema to G.B. road and told her that this is where she would work.  Prema asked what kind of work and the lady told her she would find out soon. Prema was then sold to a brothel and was told she was to have sex with men.  When she cried and refused&#44; the brothel owner said that she would have to pay her the money that she was bought for right there and then.  Prema did not have the money.  She was then sent to a room with a man who hit her and raped her mercilessly.
 She says that &quot;After that day&#44; I was a different person. I did not believe in anything in anyone.  I was raped and beaten up almost everyday&#44; every moment."  Prema soon became pregnant and says she did not want the child and hated it even before it was born. She says she &quot;was just a body with a dead soul."
 Prema was in the brothel for a year and a half before she was rescued by STOP India.  She was taken to a government shelter home where she gave birth to a baby girl.  STOP India then helped her return to her family and village. But when she returned&#44; she was not welcomed and the leaders of the village kept abusing her saying she was &quot;spoiling the character of other girls." She and her daughter then fell ill&#44; and out of desperation called Roma&#44; the "mummy" of STOP and Roma arranged for her to come and live at the family home.
 At the family home&#44; Prema met other girls and children rescued from trafficking and Roma helped her begin to love her baby&#44; whom she named Mary.  She says &quot;Today I am a different person.  I feel like a free bird that has just learnt to fly.  I am learning to take responsibilities. I want to be apart of the worthy work that STOP is carrying forward.  I look forward to a happy life for my daughter and want to educate her very well."
