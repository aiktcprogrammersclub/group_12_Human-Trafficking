											GUWAHATI: Fatema (name changed), along with some other girls from Assam's Sonitpur district, went to Mumbai seven months ago in search of jobs. A man, whom they addressed as 'mamu' (uncle), took them to Taloja in Navi Mumbai where they started working in a fish packaging factory, not realizing that they have fallen prey to a human trafficking racket. 

The girls' nightmare came to an end a few weeks ago as Maharastra Police, along with the labour department and Mumbai-based NGO My Home India, rescued them from the factory. Altogether 60 minors from Assam were rescued from the factory. 

"We worked from 9 am to 6pm. We used to clean fish and pack them for export. Some of us are suffering from skin problems now," said Fatema at Guwahati railway station. 

"We brought back 36 girls. The other 24 girls have already been handed over to their parents. All of them are between 12 and 17 years of age," said Sukesh Jha, a member of the NGO. A case has been registered against the factory management for violating labour laws, he added. 

There were 29 girls from Sonitpur and six from Baksa in the group. Four boys, who went missing from a railway station in Mumbai, have also been rescued. 

"Some local agents are sending these girls to Mumbai as cheap labourers. These traffickers get Rs 3,000 for each labourer they send," Jha added. Traffickers prefer girls because they usually cannot escape even when they are unhappy with the work. 

"This is not an isolated case. Lack of job opportunities and poor financial condition in rural Assam has resulted in many children falling prey to human trafficking. The government must properly implement rural employment schemes to deal with these issues," said a CID official. 

Expressing concern over growing incidents of trafficking of children and women in the state, chief minister Tarun Gogoi has called for proper mapping of the areas where such incidents are taking place. He has asked the social welfare department to expedite the process of setting up fast track courts and Nibhaya distress cells in each district to deal with child labour cases
